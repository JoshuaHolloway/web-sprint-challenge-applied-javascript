### B - Project Requirements

- [ ] Steps 3 and 4 are explained inside the `src/components/tabs.js` file.
- [ ] Steps 5 and 6 are explained inside the `src/components/card.js` file.

**Important Notes:**

- Please **do not move or rename existing files** or folders.
- Careful adding your script tag in Step 0: the code inside `index.js` needs the DOM to be fully built before executing.
